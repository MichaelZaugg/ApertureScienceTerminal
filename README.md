# Aperture Science Terminal 

This is the terminal that existed on aperturescience.com before it was removed. I got everything working and decided to upload it to share with everyone.
I also made a working webpage to:

https://aperturescience.thinggoeserror.net

Feel free to download it and mess around. I plan to make a little computer with this running on it as a desk decoration.

Best of luck :)

Intructions:
1. Download the project and extract
2. Run the "index.html" file on a browser of your choice.
