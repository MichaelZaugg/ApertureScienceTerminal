# Aperture Science Terminal 

This is the terminal that existed on https://www.aperturescience.com in 2007 before it was removed. I got everything working and decided to upload it to share with everyone.
I also made a working webpage at:

https://aperturescience.thinggoeserror.net

Feel free to download it and mess around. I plan to make a little computer with this running on it as a desk decoration.

Best of luck :)

Intructions:
1. Download the project and extract
2. Run the "index.html" file on a browser of your choice.

Notes:
If you don't want the terminal to close and try to open youtube or Valve's website go to the "Frame1.as.js" file and comment out lines 374 and 379 or simply delete them. The file is in "ApertureScience17.2.swf/". If you do this the terminal will simply restart.
